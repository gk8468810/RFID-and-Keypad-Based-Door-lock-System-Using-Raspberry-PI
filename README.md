# RFID-and-Keypad-Based-Door-lock-System-Using-Raspberry-PI
The RFID and Keypad Door Lock System is a secure and user-friendly access 
control device designed to enhance safety in homes, offices, and other facilities. 
By combining Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology with a 
numeric keypad, the system ensures dual-layer authentication, making it more 
reliable than traditional locking mechanisms. The system uses a microcontroller 
as its core to process user inputs and control a servo motor, which operates the 
locking mechanism.

This project focuses on creating a cost-effective and scalable solution that 
replaces conventional keys with modern access methods, reducing the risks of 
loss, duplication, and misuse. Hereâ€™s how the system works and the components 
used:
1.I2C LCD (16x2 LCD with I2C Adapter)
2.Servo Motor (e.g., SG90)
3.Numeric Keypad (4x4 Matrix Keypad)
4.RFID Reader Module (RC522)
5.Raspberry Pi Pico
6.Two LED's 
7.Buzzer
